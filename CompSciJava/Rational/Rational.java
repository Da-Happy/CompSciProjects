/*General Principles for Rational
 * 1) Internally, we will represent every Rational object with numerator and denominator integers only.  We will not use
 *    real number values (double) because they are imprecise
 * 2) Internally, we will ensure that our Rational object is ALWAYS in a "good state"  (no denominator of 0)
 * 3) Internally, we will keep the numerator and denominator in their most reduced forms.
 * 4) We will make our Rational objects basically immutable.  (no public methods will modify the numerator and denominator
 *      other than the Constructors)
